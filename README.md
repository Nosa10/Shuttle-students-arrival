# Shuttle-students-arrival

In this project, I worked on testing whether students arrival followed a poisson process
I also used 4 models, Simple Linear regression, Batch gradient descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-Batch Gradient descent to try and predict student's arrival at the Federal University of Technology, Akure between 8am - 10am.
